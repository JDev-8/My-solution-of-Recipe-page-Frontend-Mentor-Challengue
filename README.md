# Recipe page

This project has represented a significant challenge in my path as a frontend developer, possibly the most demanding to date. Confronting the specific HTML structure proposed by Frontend Mentor forced me to delve deeper into the use of CSS selectors, exploring various strategies to achieve the desired results. The need to adapt the design to a predefined structure was a stimulating challenge. Through this process, I consolidated my understanding of class selectors, IDs, attributes, and pseudo-classes, learning how to combine them effectively to target specific elements and apply precise styles to them.

With each challenge, I feel more confident and prepared to take on more complex projects. My journey in the world of frontend continues, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a developer.
